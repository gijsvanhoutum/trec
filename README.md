# TREC: A threaded video player and recorder 

**TREC** is a GUI application for video recording and playing. This application 
is especially interesting for new camera devices if they are supported by
Video4Linux.

## Main Features / Comments
Major information:

  - 4 Threads; GUI, Display, Recording, Data acquisition for speed.
  - Multiple resolutions and frame rates through Video4Linux integration
  - Easy to expand for new devices i.e. Dinolite-edge etc.
  - Build with Python,Qt, OpenCV and Numpy
  - Live frame-rate and frame-rate capacity (%) based on thread capacity

## Dependencies
Video4Linux device drivers are needed. To check run in terminal:
```sh
v4l2-ctl
```
If the package is not installed, install it with:
```sh
sudo apt install v4l-utils
```
After installation the visible devices can be checked with:
```sh
